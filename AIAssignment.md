### Part 2

I used AI for higher-level architectural design and to help me make sure I covered all edge cases whenever I am uncertain. Answers through traditional search engines are not adequate since they are not context-specific. I do not have a ton of experience with creating Express file structures, so Claude was helpful. It was also helpful in suggesting potential pitfalls when dealing with regex and middleware related questions.

### Part 3

I found that AI's response regarding regex to be pretty helpful. The AI answered my question properly and did not hallucinate, but as usual, its solution was overkill. The function it suggested was much more complex than needed for my use case. I adapted parts of it into my work by reading the output and learning about what was necessary for me to cover (newline and form feeds).

### Part 4

I learned about some line-ending styles other than the newline character. Sometimes, Mac and Windows in older versions can have other line-ending styles (\r, for example). \f is for form feeds, which is for printer new pages.
